## How to run
Prerequisites:
- Node.js 12
- Yarn (`npm install -g yarn`)

1. Install the dependencies
    ```
    yarn install
    ```

2. Run the development server
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```
Now your app is available at `http://localhost:3000`. Keep in mind that you should have the server (or services) running for the
 app to work appropriately.
